# image-gallery

This is an assesment task showing I've completed MDN Web Docs tutorial on JavaScript building blocks.

It's a photo gallery showing photos from my last years trip to Paris, France!
You can click between different photo miniatures, which when pressed, show the photo in full resolution.
A bonus feature is a button that toggles light/dark mode, changing the user experience.

Enjoy!
